hi everyone welcome back once again toCareer queue a place to curate yourcareer in today's video I will besharing with you my stress or rather thestress that the company has given us andthis time the name of the company is HClas you might have seen already in uh thethumbnail as well however HCL has donesomething which has again brought a lotof stress on the it employees alltogether and that is the topic ofdiscussion for today so let's Deep diveinto the video and know more on what HCLhas done in its newest of the new casesso you know HCL has recently publishedthis uh news in the media confirmingthat the performance pay or theperformance pay factor that was there inour salaries that will be removed fromits uh salaries of the employees andthat the employees will not be gettingtheir performance pay anymore uh youknow on a monthly basis so if guys ifyou do not know what performance pay isthen let me tell you that performancepay is one of the many factors that getadded up to your salary uh to your Iwould say thefix CDC and uh it is a component thatwill be present on your salary slip youjust need to go over and check yoursalary slip approximately 80 percent ofthe entire I.T sector uh gives thisperformance pay as one of the componentsand in the salary breakup and you knowan employee is uh entitled to get hisperformance pay each month however uhnow HCL has released this thing in whichit has said that uh you know it will notbe giving the performance pay on amonthly basis rather it will be givingthis uh salary in or it will be addingthis on a quarterly basis so now everythree months you will be getting yourperformance pay now we all know now whyis this a matter of issue or a matter ofstress for us because we all know thatall sister companies function alike weknow that so you know now that HCL hasdone this it has removed the performancepage from your monthly salary and youknow added it somewhere elseso all the other it companies will alsodo the same so you know uh it is like atrend that continues so we are worriedthat you know one factor or one majorfactor so okay let me tell you that thisperformance pay it really varies on thelevel of uh salary or percentage uhsalary percentage that you are gettingso uh say for example uh if you are asenior or a mid senior level employeelike three to four years of or fiveyears of experienced employees then youmight be given given a good amount suchas ten thousand or twelve thousand asyour performance pay so yeah it is thathigh an amount so you know we aretalking about a high or a good chunk ofmoney and not just a few hundreds okayso that is why if this one component isremoved your salary will actually getaffected a lot so you know and when itwill come in the uh after three monthsin the quarterly on the quarterly basisif even if it comes as a lump sum therewill be a huge amount of tax deductionwe must note that as well so you knowover and over so you know uh in all thispolicy actually brings uh the employeesto a really tough spot because theirsalaries are getting reduced and whenyou know when you will be entitled toget it even at that point you will bepaying a high amount of income tax on itso you know it is something that is uhworrisome and it is something thatactually you know as employees we thinkthat it is not done okay now anotherfactor to this in addition is thatperformance pay will only be given tothe employees who are a part of aproject okay so say for example you aresomeone who is sitting in bench okay soyou will not be entitled to Performancepay because you're not performing rightthat is what they have said so becauseor as you have not performed you are notworking in any of the things or you'renot contributing to any of the thingsyou will be not be entitled to thisperformance pay at all and even onquarterly basis you will be not gettingit so you know this is something that uhI feel personally is the wrongest everdecision because you know when does anemployee come on bench any employee whenhe or she joins into an organization theemployee wants to be a part of theorganization he or she wants to workokay when does an employee come on benchat times when the organization is notable to give a project to the employeeright the projects might be shut down ormaybe the organization has over hired orwhatever the case may be there can benumerous cases but if you are on benchyou are not entitled to one section ofyour salary can you believe that likewhen you were joining it was a part ofCDC that is why you joined it becausemaybe in some other organization youwere not getting this part and now thatyou are or you have joined into HCL andnow after this uhand now after uh this Sudden Change thatthey have brought in their entire salarystructure so now that part of your CTCAis not given to you it has been movedfrom fixed CTC to variable CDC and it isnot a part of you know or it will not begiven to you so that is something that Ifeel is very wrong because firstly anemployee is not uh you know willingly onbench secondly uh even if you're not onbench even if you are in a projectcontributing and you are entitled toyour performance pay you will not begetting it on a monthly basis insteadyou will be getting it on quarterlybasis and again it has been you knowreduced or it has been removed from thefixed CDC to the variable CDC whichmeans on a quarterly basis how much thecompany is performing right how much ifit is not performing that well it willnot be entitled to that much of theamount if it is it has performed wellthen maybe they will be giving you theoriginal amount that they were givingyou previously so you you know this isactually a decision that um is notactually in the favor so you know thisactually is a decision that is not infavor of the employees and uh all of youguys all of the new freshers or maybeexperienced people who have an offerfrom HCL then uh please watch this videoand uh give it a double thought whetheryou should be or whether you are goingto join this organization because if youare going to join this organizationright now then this will be applicableto you as well to all the new joinersthis will be applicable to you so youknow you need to make an uh informeddecision so that you know whenever whenyou go inside the organization nothingcomes as a shock to you so that's thetopic of discussion for today's video Ihope that I have been able to tell youor share with you what uh currently isgoing in the on in the market andespecially in HCL we just hope that youknow this is not copy pasted by theother organizations because if it doesthen you know this is really a shockerfor all the it employees the entire IITcommunity on a whole because you knowuh it is a huge or a heavy chunk of oursalaries so that is why we are soconcerned about it and to all the HCLguysum there I don't think there is much youcan do about itum and to all the new joiners who haveoffers from HCL then uh yes uh from youor you can actually uh you know thinktwice before joining and take aninformed decisionum if there is anything that I havemissed out or there's anything that youwant to put uh then please put them downin the comment section it willdefinitely be beneficial for the entireaudience on a whole if you like thevideo don't forget to hit the likebutton and also subscribe to the channelI'll come
