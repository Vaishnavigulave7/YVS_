On August 12, 2021 I joined TCS. This was the first day of my corporate life. After that I did induction for around 2 weeks. I didn't have any training, I just did my I-Volume courses. I had a lot of friends, my college friends,. my school friends, many people joined T.CS. So when I got the call, I said no, I can't do it, it doesn't match my skillset.
