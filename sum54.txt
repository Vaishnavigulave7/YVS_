I saw a post on a Facebook group whichwas saying that somebody got a offerfrom Accenture and then they resignedfrom their current company but after fewdays they saw that Accenture is layingoff people. I was really puzzled that how cansomebody go ahead and ask for suchadvice from random people on theinternet. We need to be very clear in our mind with respect to what career move or whatjob change are we actually going for ifyou look holistically.
