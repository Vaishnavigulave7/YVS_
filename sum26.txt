On January 20th, Luke came to work like he always does. After a long meeting, he tries to relax from all the work he did today. Then he heads over to the gym to work out, even if his back is killing him. After lunch is over, he quickly makes his way back to the micro kitchen to grab something that's going to keep him going.
