Aishwarya: Comparison is a bad thing but sometimes it's a good thing. Today we will compare two big companies TCS and IBM. If you have both the offers, you will be able to decide whether I should go to TCS or IBM. As always I am not going to say that you should hold this or that. I will keep my points straight.
