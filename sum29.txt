Google has 3 offices in Bangalore, but where I work is RMZ Infinity. Our workspace is open, but if you want to talk to someone, have one-on-one meetings. There are meeting rooms and a calling booth. Our cafeteria is no less than 5 stars, and the food is also amazing. There is a very good gym with trainers. I will also start the gym from next Monday.
