thecompensation breakup which is mentionedin the offer letter only that one if youhave from that you cannot calculate theexact amount which you will get in handokay but somewhere around how much

for a monthto know your enhanced salary you canknow it before itself but make sure youshould have the compensation breakupwhich i am going to share you in just awhileokay i am going to explain each andeverything and which you need toconsider for your monthly enhancedsalaryokaysee first i'll tell youin offer letter how you will get andthen i'll show you the compensationbreaker okay i'll show you somewhere inthe screen you can look into thatso an azure one compensation andbenefitsannual compensation structure as per thecompany guidelines are total cashcompensation elementsannual fixed compensation is 8 lakhokay it is mentioned as 8 lakh see assoon as you look into this eight lakhwhat people will do usually isthey'll take this component eight lakhand they divide by twelve so whateverthe figure will get they'll think thatthat is what they'll get in handnothat is also not the salary what you getin hand okay so i'll come into that justuh we'll we'll finish this uplocal variable bonus earning potentialso this is your minimum 0 percentmaximum 16 percent is mentioned hereokaysee this lvbyou won't get it in monthly basis thisyou will get it in accenture this youwill get it twice in a year in accentureyou will get it in the month of may andin the month of november okayso it will not be like if they havementioned as 16 percent you will get 16percent only noyou don't get 16 percent here they havementioned minimum 0 to maximum 16percentit may vary okay you can't expectsixteen percent completely you will getit it may vary based on company'sperformance based on your performance itmay vary okay so keep that in mindminimum is zero percent maximum issixteen percent and one more thing whenit comes to lvb what you have tokeep in mind is see understand this verycarefullylocal variable bonus you won't get tillyou allocate to any projectokay once you start working on theproject then only the local variablebonus will get calculated okay let's sayfor example you have join in the monthof what is this month february okaylet's say you have joined in the monthof februaryokaybut you got the project in the month ofmarch not in the february okay so thenhow the lvb calculatedfrom march it will calculate march apriland may only for this three months youwill get local variable bonus not forthe month of february because in thefebruary you have not allocated to anyproject you are sitting idle you are notworking on the project right so onlythese three monthsof lvb you will get itgot it okay only when you're working onthe project only for those months youwill get the lbb not for the monthswhich you're sitting either let's sayyou have joined the company in the monthof february and you didn't get theproject in the month of june februaryalso march also you got it in aprilapril and may only two months of lvbwill get it not the full understand thisvery carefullyokay this is how the lbb works inaccenture only in the month of may andin the month of november
