hi friends welcome back to my channel again. so in this video I am going to comparetwo companies which is IBM and Accenturelet's jump into the video[Music]friends I have opened a Google Chromeand searched for IBM Glassdoor and Ihave then selected Accenture to comparethe companiesso basically uh IBM is an InformationTechnology support services there isanother subsidiary of IBM called IBMLabs it is a product based and this IBMis a service basedand Accenture is purely service basedcompanyit's a business Consulting and most ofthe roles would be technicaland then keeping that aside both havetheir big markets you know Big Share inthe markets in across the globe I wouldsay and keeping that aside let's talkabout the salaries in both the companiesso when it comes to the salariesfor application developer IBM is paying8 lakh Perma eight lakh per annumwhereas software engineer salary inAccenture is 5 lakh 50 000. andAssociated systems engineer this is thefreshest trolley from Norton 4 lakh 34000 for like 35 000 and applicationsdevelopment unless salaries six lakh 50000 in Accenture and the seniorconsultant salary is 12 lakh 84 000 inIBM whereas in Accenture it is 21 lakhso these are the these are some salariesin both the companies so if you noticeyou know Accenture is paying moresalaries than IBMso you can conclude one point thatAccenture is going to pay you more thanIBM so let's talk about overall ratingwhich has given by the employees so bothboth the companies are having 4.1 ratingwhich is you can assume both are bettercompanies in in the currently existedmarket so let's start about uh before westart to you know uh consider this everyone of the factorculture and values diversity andinclusion and Senior Management thesethis doesn't show much impact directlyon the employeebut these two things are something willdefinitely impact the employee so if ifyou notice uh you know culture andvalues this is out of our scope howeveralmost same this is 4.2 and this is 4.1diversity and English and also almostsame and 4.1 work-life balance IBM worklife balance is higher and Accentureworkload balance is lower and SeniorManagement IBM scores higher and almostsame and compensation and benefitsAccenture is Accenture has higher salarythan the IBM and career opportunitiesare almost same so these are the overallratings of the companyand keeping that aside let's talk aboutemployee sentiment for both thecompaniesso when it comes to the employeesentiments ninety percent of theemployees are approving their CEO forthe IBM 84 percent of the employees arerecommending their friends to join inIBM and 72 percent the company has apositive business Outlook but when itcomes to the Accenture 94 of theemployees are approving their CEO 86percent of the employees arerecommending their friends to join inAccenture ready to person the companyAccenture as a positive business Outlookso when it comes to the uh you knowemployee sentiment Accenture rates thetop rather than the IBM so this issomething we need to take care of I meanconsider before we joining the companyso let's talk about uh pros and consworking in both the companiesso good working environment flexibleworking hours or the pros working in thecompany and cons are like salary hackand low service and Pros in Accentureare good salary and employee friendlycons are long working hours and variablepayso both the companies have its dedicatedpros and dedicated consso let's start talking about the futurereview future review great a greatwork-life balance and great careeropportunities

friendlyinitial 2.5 you will get nice healthycompared to other competitors chance tolearn and work on latest technology likeblockchain and coming to the consexperience people will get low salary sothese are a couple of reviews futurereviews related to both the companiesand uh if uh you know I have reviewedIBM company separately and Accenturecompany separately in my previous videosso I recommend you to take a look so youwill have some brighter pictureand uh there are eight thousand dollarsposted by IBM in the glass door whereasAccenture has posted 40 000 jobs in theglass door so a couple of jobs are likeAssociated systems Engineers supportengineer Network support engine andTechnical Support engineer whereas forAccenture epic system applicationsupport no technology specialization butapplication support engineer applicationsupport in general so these are thecouple of roles that this company ishavingso these are the reviews friends Irecommend you to watch my previousvideos as well for individual reviewsrelated to the companyso if you ask me which company you needto join it is a bit complicated questionfor me to answer but however in thisvideo we need to conclude thatso if you if you take a look atcompensation and benefits part I preferAccenture as my first priority and IBMas my second priority and when it comesto the work life balance I prefer IBM asmy first priority and Accenture as mysecond priority because work lifebalance is something you know it is likeyou can assume work pressure or longworking hours or rotis that is somethingfalls under work love balance so theseare my recommendations which company youneed you need to join you can decidebased upon this video I hope you likethis video friends that's it for thisvideo in my upcoming
