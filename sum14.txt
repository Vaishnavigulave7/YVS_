Bijay: If you are freshers, you can estimate your work-life balance for a few years. If you do not get projects immediately, and this is very common, there is nothing to worry about. After training, you have to go to the bench. And that too in TCS, it is very normal. It is not necessary that you have a project ready immediately.
