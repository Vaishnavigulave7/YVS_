Tatashowroom and you can check this out okayguys so this is one additional featurethe next point is maternity leave okayrecently guys we received an email fromone of our viewers or rather I will callsubscribers that she joined she wasgoing to join thesis on a specific dateand she got to know that she is pregnantright so what happened was she wasafraid to ask the TCS HR that should uhshould I tell the tshr that I'm pregnantand uh as like uh I will not be able toI will be able to do the office only forthree or four months and then I'll haveto go and leave a maternity leave sothen what happened was we told her thatbe honest with HR and tell the HR nowwhat happens mostly in most cases isthat if you tell the HR about this kindof situation uh the HR will tell youthat they will revoke your offer returnyour joining letter right they will giveyou some other date so this didn'tdidn't happen at pieces because thesishas a lot of employees that are joiningand you will not be joining any specificproject right so when thesis hires okayof even for experience or even forpressures what thesis does this thesishas a lot of pool of employees that arealready there on bench or rather underthe training period okay so what happensis there are a lot of employees andthere are a lot of projects that areavailable so when you are interviewingfor any position okay like uh as a Javadeveloper or a spring boot developer sowhat happens is that you can work indifferent projects and there aremultiple projects that are availableright so that is the reason why TCS hasa pool of employees and they can manageit okay but when you go to some uhproduct based computer specific companythey are hiring for a specific roleright so that is the reason they theycannot comprehensiate or they cannotcompromise on that kind of thing so thatis the reason why TCS and the recentlywe got to know that the HR approved thematernity leave also like they told herthat you on your joint pieces you workfor these many days and then you will beassigned the maternity leave you cantake it as per the rules and regulationsso that is a one good thing that Iobserved at TCS now let us let usdiscuss about the loan okay so if youare planning to take a loan what you cando is you can visit the Tata Capitalwebsite okay so if you want to take ahome loan or if you want to take apersonal loan or even if you want totake a vacation or something alone forany anything okay you can go to Tatacapital website and you will be gettinggood interest rates okay so compared toother people so that is the reason thisis one of the benefit while using Tatauh the starter capital okay the nextthing is your higher education a lot ofpeople actually want to pursue theirhigher education but they are scaredwhether should I leave the job should Iuh like I will not be able to join thisgroup again so everyone knows that Tatadoes not have a data group does not havea really higher policy rate if you leavedata it is for forever you will not beable to join data group again uh likethere can be some circum circumstancesin which you will be able to join butmostly it is no okay so what happens isyou are given six to two videos of uhwill leave without pay okay so in thatperiod what you can do is accept it iscalled a sabbatical leave so what youcan do is you can complete your highereducation or if you want to careercareer break you can also do that a lotof people have seen that a lot of peopleafter two completely in two to threeyears they take a sabbatical leave forsix months and they travel all over theworld okay so you can do that as well ifyou have that kind of intention okay youcan trans the world you can do a lot forthe things you can do some pgdm coursesyou can go for higher education butthere is a Twist over here that you haveto complete minimum two years for takingthis to your kind of leave okay so thisis another twist now you can discuss allthese policies you can take all thesuggestions and you can createeverything you can first connect with HRand the HR will uh like give you all theresources to go through the entireprocess and everything okay now one moreimportant thing that I've observed isthat a thesis has a Toastmasters clubsokay so if you go to any office or ifyou go to any location Pune Chennai oreven Bangalore you will be having twosmart Masters Club okay uh registeredpostmaster Club wherein you will be ableto uh be a member and all of the thingsis completely sponsored by thesis Iwould not say completely sponsoredbecause uh a certain amount of fees youcan reimburse you can get it reimbursedfrom TCS okay now if you want to knowabout uh you can also get yourheadphones or even your bikes orsomething like that accessories that youhave purchased for attending meetings orsomething like that okay can also linkfor services as well like if you have alaptop has been hanged or if there isany issue with the laptop you can alsoclaim for that okay we have made anentire video on that you can go andwatch in the uh you can go I will keepthe link in the description you can goand watch that video okay guys we are ina hurry we are making this video in ahurry because you have to release itright so the next thing is thatToastmasters I was talking aboutToastmasters so here what will happen isyou will be able to improve yourcommunication skills second isleadership skills and personal skillsI think this is the best thing aboutteachers that you will be able to becomea part of Toastmasters Club and will beable to participate actively in thatokay so uh apart from that you also havemany classes or sessions uh conducted inthesis campus recently I saw a postabout salsa dance company they will betraining you for salsa you can learnsalsa for free of cost okay for all theTC's employees it was started in Pune Idon't know about Bangalore or generalKrishna but it has already started inPune so you can also go and check withyour HR or your uh other team members orproject managers they will be knowingabout it okay guys there are a lot ofthings that are happening we'll updateyou all as soon as possible to get anyupdates okay guys so please like thisvideo share
