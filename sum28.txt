So I usually wake up around 7 a.m. and get ready for work. I tend to go into the office two to three days a week. So I usually walk to the office but today it was kind of raining so I decided to take the bus. So once I get home around 6-6:30 we usually go for a walk but today we also had to do some groceries.
