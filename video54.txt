[Music]hi everyone welcome to Career talk todayI saw a post on a Facebook group whichwas saying that somebody got a offerfrom Accenture and then they resignedfrom their current company but after fewdays they saw that Accenture is layingoff people so this question on aFacebook group is asking for some adviceon whether now this person should goahead with the offer that they'vereceived from Accenture or whether theyshould go back to their current employerand say that they are not resigning theywant to stay back in the same companywhen I saw this post on a Facebook groupI was really puzzled that how cansomebody go ahead and ask for suchadvice from random people on theinternet even today when somebodyreaches out to me for any advice firstthing that I ask them is to share theresume and their LinkedIn profile then Iasked them why are you resigning what isthe real reason why you're resigningwhat is that you're getting from the newcompany is your current problem thatyou're facing today in this companygetting solved if you join this newcompany there are variety of questionsand answers that I ask and then wearrive at a decision whether leavingthis company or joining the new companyis a good decision or not but in thisrandom Facebook post there's so manypeople giving their own opinions and Ithink it is not a great way to arrive ata decision remember that companies willcontinue to hire and fire one dayAccenture will fire some people next daythey will hire another set of peoplebecause they know there are so manytalented people out there who are eagerto work for them so even if they firetoday they can hire tomorrow it is notjust about Accenture but about all thecompanies out there it is very clearthat they are out there to do businessand we need to be very clear in our mindwith respect to what career move or whatjob change are we actually going for ifyou look holistically Accenture TCSInfosys be Pro cognizant Google AmazonFacebook these are big companies hugecompanies so working for any of thesecompanies is actually a largely gooddecision right right but you need toback your skills you need to know whythey are hiring you you need to knowwhat is your expertise what is yourexperience and how it will get utilizedif you join these companies and let megive you this recent example ofAccenture when they decided to let go 19000 people they said very clearly thatwe will let go these people in duecourse of time and not immediately whichmeans they will pick and choose rolesthat they don't need which means theywill pick and choose people that theydon't need or people who don't fit intotheir larger scheme of things whichmeans people in whom they don't seepotential for the future so companiesare very clear and very focused whenthey make certain business decisions soas individuals also we need to be veryclear in our mind about the kind ofdecisions we are making we should keepemotions aside we should bring practicaland logical reasons of why we are doingcertain things asking random people togive you advice on the internet is notat all a good idea you need to be veryclear of the moves that you are makingin your career they should be backed byLogic and not by emotion and wheneveryou land into these kind of situationswhere there is panic in the market wherepeople are worried about layoffs youneed to also understand what kind oflayoffs are happening when Accentureannounced the layoffs they clearly toldthat this time they're going to let go alot of people working in the corporatefunctions corporate functions is a verydifferent thing IIT is a very differentthing billable roles are a differentthing non-billable roles are a differentthing so whenever such announcements aremade about layoffs we need to alsodouble click and understand why thathappened and whether it is going toimpact the sales team marketing teamcorporate functions or non-corporatefunctions or B level functions ordelivery or software functions we needto be very clear about these news itemsas well so just being at a surface leveland getting panicked about all of theselayoff news is not a good thing if youhave made your decision to joinAccenture or for that matter any startupor any company it has to be backed bysolid information Mission and logicbecause even if Accenture has laid offso many people I am sure many of you whoare watching this video will be veryhappy to apply for a job at Accenturebecause if you need it you will applyfor it if you are in desperate need youwill always go for it companies knowthat and you also know that this is myneed this is why I want to join thiscompany because I don't have any otheroptions at this point in time if you geta better option you will jump on thebetter option so it is always
