In August 2021 I have received my offer letter from Accenture. After getting the offer letter I didn't join the Accenture immediately because I was working in another company where I was having the notice period of 90 days. There was no pay out options available for me. I miss this opportunity if anybody is having this kind of opportunity they can join by paying whatever Accenture is.
