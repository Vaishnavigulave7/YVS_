In this video I am going to comparetwo companies which is IBM and Accenture. Both the companies are having 4.1 rating which is you can assume both are bettercompanies in in the currently existedmarket. Accenture is Accenture has higher salarythan the IBM and career opportunitiesare almost same. If you want to join Accenture it is a complicated question but if you take a look atcompensation and benefits I prefer Accenture as my first priority.
