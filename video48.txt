And second one is you will also get a joining bonus for freshers it is about 25,000 and but I am not sure but as I heard from someone that now Kindle is providing a joining bonus of 50,000 I think.I am not sure but this is what I heard from someone.
And second perk is like you will get the shift allowance like 6 to 7 shifts are there like and so on.Night shift is also there.So for these shifts you will get some allowance like 100, 200, 300, 400 rupees it depends which shift you are working in.
So suppose you are working in a shift for which you are getting allowance of 300 to 400 then obviously your salary will bump to like 35,000 to 40,000 per month as a fresher and I think it is quite good as compared to other companies like Bipro, Kogury and Capgemini which provide a package of 3.5 for something like this.So this is the second perk and one thing because they are like for every shift you will get some allowance.So if your salary will obviously increase by 4 to 5,000 obviously it will increase.For every shift some allowance is there like 200, 200, 300, 400 something like this.And other thing is there every 3 months you will get some like GDP is there like the company shares some profit its profit with the employees.So you will get some amount for that also GDP and after every 3 months.So this thing is also there and one more thing is there like you will get some amount like to spend on your headsets or UPS you can buy something you will get a previously it was 22,000 but now it was increased to 29,000 so you can order headsets both rupees 20,000 and even a UPS of it depends which one you want to order it can be 5,000 rupees or can be 7,000 rupees it depends on you and one is the internet allowance is also up to 1500 you will get and every 6 months you will get some blue points.Blue points are I don't know much about blue points but in the last salary that I got there was mentioned that this is what you got as in blue points and one thing was there you will get 400 points every year that you can give someone you can appreciate you can appreciate your colleagues your team members like you can distribute among your colleagues and team members and they can also give you that points 400 points is about 5 to 7,000 rupees so if you are getting it suppose you are a someone some team members is donating you or appreciating you with 100 points then it's about 1200 to 1400 rupees 1400 rupees so this is what we get in IBM I think the salary that IBM provides to the freshers is much higher than that of the other companies it can be Bipro it can be Covenant it can be Capchini so if you are planning to like join IBM or Kintel the salary structure and everything about similar so if you want to join then I will say that it's quite good for freshers and in the last video someone said that why don't you speak in Hindi why you are speaking in English so for those guys who said that I just want to say I am from Punjab and I know Punjabi only so if I just want to speak in there I will mix up Punjabi and Hindi so I will say as you to see so try to understand I am just speaking English just for your sake not for mine so so this is all for today's video these are the only perks that we get and for freshers I will say IBM is the best so IBM Kintel is the best if you want to join and see you in the next video I will just bring the unboxing of the headsets that I got from Kintel and okay bye bye see you in the next video.
