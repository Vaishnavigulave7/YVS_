Manish: If you have got a job in TCS and you are thinking that money is money then I can say that this is your misunderstanding because after a long time you have a meme. The ideal salary of TCS employee after 2 years of experience will be between 4.24-4.5 LPA so if you want to take an average then take 4.3 LPA and your enhanced salary will be around 31-32k LPA.
