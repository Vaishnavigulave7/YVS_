Hello my beautiful people out there welcome back to my YouTube channel so today's video is all about what happened after getting the offer letter okay I have received my offer letter from Accenture and also after getting the offer letter I didn't join the Accenture immediately because I was working in another company where I was having the notice period of 90 days three months of notice period I was having so I have to serve complete 90 days there was no pay out options available for me so I have not joined the Accenture immediately okay what happened is August 2021 I have received my offer letter so in September I got one mail from Accenture people what they have sent is they have told me to join early like they have told me to join in September end but but I was not having any payout options what they have given me the offer was they told me that they'll give the payout whatever your company will tell to pay out for the notice period we are we are ready to pay for that okay if that option is available you just pay that amount we are going to pay you in your along with your first salary and also told me like we are ready to increase your joining bonus as well if you join us immediately in September end but the thing is I was not having any options like payout in my company I have to serve the complete 90 days so I miss this opportunity if anybody is having this kind of opportunity they can join by paying whatever the Accenture is if the Accenture people is ready to pay you can pay to your company and you can join to them whenever they want to but in my case the situation was different my company was not allowing me to join the other company before 90 days I have to serve the complete 90 days then only I can go to Accenture okay so here one question comes what is joining bonus did you get the joining bonus yes I have received the joining bonus from Accenture so anybody who is going to join in Accenture based on their eligibility they'll get the joining bonus okay this option is this benefit is available in Accenture okay so what is this joining bonus is all about see joining bonus is the bonus which company pays you when you're going to join to their company okay the amount which is excluding your CTC it is not included in your CTC it is excluding your CTC which is giving you as a bonus joining bonus when you when you are going to join that company okay the main thing is when you're getting the joining bonus you have to you have to be there in that company for at least one year if you're going to leave that company you have to within one year you have to pay that amount whatever the X amount they'll give you as a joining bonus that you have to give to them then only you can leave that company but if you're leaving the company after one year then you need you no need to pay that many people ask me that is the joining bonus is beneficial obviously man why not joining bonus is some huge amount which we are getting apart from our salary why won't we get that it is generally 10% of your CTC okay max to max I think it is up to 30% you'll get but understand that it will not be paid every year only when you're going to join that company at that initial month along with your salary that amount will be credited to your bank but that will not be paid every year make sure that and understand that it is mostly used to stuff the CTC just to make sure that your package is very good okay but it is not going to pay you every year only once it it will be paid see but the thing is as the joining bonus comes only once better if you have the opportunity like instead of this joining bonus if you can increase your CTC let's say some 10,000 every month or some 5,000 every month you go for that option instead of this joining bonus okay that is better.
