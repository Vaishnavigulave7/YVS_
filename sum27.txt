CNN's John Sutter takes you on a tour of the Google campus in Mountain View, California. Sutter says he prefers working at the YouTube campus because it's less crowded and the location is closer to San Francisco. He also says the traffic is far better over at YouTube because of the number of cafes and cafeterias on the campus.
