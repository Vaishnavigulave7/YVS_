Manisha: I am going to talk about this video with my own perspective. Many people ask me that do you regret quitting TCS or would you join TCS again if their policy is rehired again. So see, a good time is to leave something So you should leave at that time. If you stay for a long time somewhere Maybe if you feel good, you are in your comfort zone.
