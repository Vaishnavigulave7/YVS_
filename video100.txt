videoHi Guys morning!Yes momYou are going?Yes!Hi guys good morningSo now we are going to the gymand after coming back from the gym we are going to the Noida officeThere are two offices we will be going to the second oneThe first one which we have already been to and the second one is the bird sanctuary one So today we will be going to the bird sanctuary oneNow let's go to the gymIt's 8:10 alreadyWe have to leave at 9:30So recently I came to Delhi againSo i have been working from home for a whileSo I thought lets go to the Noida OfficeWhy? because I have a friend an internHe is working in Microsoft, he is a junior from school and collegeI asked him do you have any plans to go to officeHe told me he is going tomorrow so I said I will also comeSo alright guys we are going to the officeWe are completely readyNow we just have to wear shoesIt is already 10And I have to meet my friend at the metro station at 10Who is the intern?I will tell you the rest after meeting himSo lets get ready soon and leave quicklySo this is the one thing that I love after this Covid situationThis hybrid work environment or this hybrid work modelwhich companies have started to adoptThat for some time you can work from anywhere And for the rest you have to be in officeI really really really love itBecause earlier if you had to go home you had to take a holidayYou can take work from home nowYou can easily go back home to your familyIf you wanna go for a vacation you can do that tooYou can explore new placesand work at the same timeI do not know a better thing than thisAfter 1 hour 20 minutes finallyWe have reached Noida Sector 18Now lets quickly catch a cab and go the officeIts already so tiring the metro rideBut I was missing this metro ride in HyderabadSo the best thing I like about Delhiapart from the food is transportationIf you wanna go from point 1 to point 2You need not think muchThe metro connectivity is so vastWherever you wanna go just check the nearest metro stationThere are so many lines so many thingsand really its is pretty easySouth west Delhi to Noida is a big headache because of traffic jams and stuffBut with metro you can travel very easilyIt takes time I agree but you reach pretty soonFinally we have reached the officeLet us go inside quicklyIt took us a long timeSo there are two development centres in Noidarecently Microsoft opened another oneFirstly they opened the TajWe had made a video on the Taj oneIf you have not seen it alreadyit will be available in the i buttonyou can definitely check it outSo other than this Microsoft opened another office in KP towersThat is inspired by the Okhla bird sanctuaryand guys its actually very prettyTill now I have seen three offices of MicrosoftI have not seen the Bangalore oneSo the Hyderabad one and Taj one is extremely prettyThe Kp towers Okhla bird sanctuary ones are so pretty as wellHow do you feel coming to the office?Its the first experienceIt seems so bigEverything seems big !You came in this one?No not in this oneI had been to the Taj officeLets explore thisAll the things are same in all officesThe stuff you are getting in the Hyderabad office and over here is the sameThe difference is only the interiorThe caterers and interiors are differentThe food is slightly differentBut the entry process and stuff is exactly the sameHow are you feeling coming to the office?Everything feels newIts fun looking at the deskThis is your first experience right in any office in general?Yeah I mean I have been in a few start ups But other than that in an actual big office its my first timeSo it feels goodI actually feel you can work over hereYou have not even seen the main stuffNow we will go for lunchEven over here you get free snacks like coffee and stuffBut vending machines are missingI get really happy pressing those buttons in the vending machineThat is missing over hereNow Microsoft has a lot of floors in the KP towers officeso I had gone to the 7th and 6th floorThey are extremely prettyBoth have a different theme I had gone to the 7th floor firstThe seating was not there in the 7th floor and I had to attend a few meetingSo the meeting room was not availablePeople were already
