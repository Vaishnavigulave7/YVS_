hi everyone welcome to Career talk todaywe are going to discuss a very importanttopic which is how to make decisionswhile changing jobs and we will take oneexample and the example goes like thisyou are working with TCS with a currentsalary of six lakhs and you are lookingoutside that's when you get an offerfrom Accenture which is for 10 lakhs soyou're getting a hike of 4 lakhs fromyour current CTC or 6 lakhs you get theoffer letter and you go ahead and resignor you start the discussion with yourmanager in TCS in this example that youwant to quit and that is when yourcurrent manager tells you that they wantyou to stay they want you to stay withthe same company they don't want you togo so in order to retain you they offeryou an on-site opportunity and now youare confused whether you should staywith TCS in this example or 6 lakhs plusa promise of on-site or whether youshould go ahead with the offer of 10lakhs which is coming from Accenturethis is a very common scenario notexactly like this but a lot of peopleget into such situations where theircurrent employer wants them to stay andthey promise that okay we will send youon site and that's when people getconfused so before I go ahead and sharemy Approach and my logic I want you topause this video go to the commentsection and please write what would youdo if you were in this situation whatwould you do and why so the why isimportant because it is not just arandom decision we are taking let's alsotalk about why before you play thisvideo any further please do that so thatwe understand what is your thoughtprocess all right I hope you have madethat comment about your decision andyour approach now let me tell you myApproach if I was that candidate thefirst thing which would come to my mindis why is this manager proposing thison-site opportunity to mean now why wasa similar opportunity not given to meearlier if it was given earlier as wellthen probably it's a differentdiscussion but if it was not givenearlier the question is how is thismanager going to come up with theon-site opportunity for which customerfor which account for which project forwhich country these are the questionswhich will come up in my mind as anemployee so I would go ahead and have adiscussion and clarify all these thingsif I get specific answers from mymanager saying that we will send you onsite in this particular role for thisparticular customer and this particularproject in the next three months or sixmonths then it gives me a lot ofconfidence that okay there is a thoughtprocess behind his proposal of asking meto stay in the same company if there areno specifics if this is like a plainGeneral response that we will find outopportunities and we will send you infuture then it is something which willmake me a little worried all right so asa employee I want specific details nextthing when it comes to Country there aredifferent onset opportunities indifferent countries depending on whereis the customer located and what is theproject you know they may send you toSouth Africa they may send you toAustralia Europe different countries inEurope Mexico Philippines there are somany countries of course U.S and stufflike that so there are so many countrieswhere TCS may have on-site opportunitiesso in this case we need to also be veryclear about the Visa process eachcountry has its own work permit and Visaprocess and sometimes it takes days butsometimes it takes weeks and sometimesit takes months or years to get the visadone there are variety of different typeof work permits available with respectto each country and that is why whenyour manager proposes an onsetopportunity you have to be very clearabout which country and what is theprocess and how much time it's going totake because as an employee you need tounderstand stand what is the waitingperiod okay even if you are going tostay and say yes I want to go on siteyou need to be very clear in your mindhow much time it's going to takeotherwise if you are not clear one daywill become one week one week willbecome one month and one month willbecome six months six months will becomeone year and you will keep on waitingand your frustration will start to buildup because you've already left an offerof 10 lakhs on the table okay you havesaid no root 10 lakhs and you arewaiting for this on-site opportunitywhich is somewhere in future now let mealso give you examples of what I haveseen in real life I have seen bothscenarios in real life where people havesaid no to answered opportunitiesresigned and taken another job okay thiswas not PCS versus Accenture I knowpeople who were holding H1 Visa butbecause there was no Clarity on whenthey would travel they said no we don'twant to stay and we don't want to go onside I would rather go and join a newcompany at a better her salary I haveseen people do that that is scenario oneI've also seen scenario two where peoplehave spent months and years in thewaiting okay people have got their visadone and they have waited for one monthtwo months six months one year in factat one point in time I have waited forsix months as well so there are peoplewho wait for one year two years also tojust get that on-site opportunity thereis no right or wrong between whether youtake the decision of moving on orwhether you take the decision to staywhat you need to understand is what youare getting into with the right kind ofinformation and details because if yoursalary is six lakhs and if you aregetting a offer of 10 lakhs and if theonset opportunity is in U.S there isdefinitely no way you can compare it 10lakh package with eighty thousand dollaror a hundred thousand dollar package inthe US is way way more than the 10 lakhsalary in India so you can't compareboth the opportunities in a monetary wayin most cases the answer it is alwaysheavy unless you have a package of like50 60 lakhs in India okay that's adifferent discussion so be very carefulwith the specifics don't just rely onfalse promises or just promises madeover there for you to stay okay ifrequired you should talk to one level upso that you get a lot of confidence thatokay this is going to happen also beaware that okay if you get the onsiteopportunity for how long will it existwill it exist for three months sixmonths one year two years what timeduration otherwise they may promise youanswered opportunity which may be on abusiness Visa which may just end up infew weeks so that may not be a very goodfinancial decision because you will justgo to onsite for few days and come backand then probably you will just stayhere in India okay so things like thatyou need to get into the details of whythey are sending you where they aresending you how they will send whichproject how much salary and stuff likethat if you get those details and if youare able to compare and if you get theconfidence then you yes you can make adecision to stay within the same companyand give up on the new offer that youhave if you don't have that kind ofpatience if you think that the offer inhand is of more value and you don't havethat kind of patience then just go forthe new offer from Individual toindividuals these decisions will bedifferent for someone money is onefactor but for other people theinternational exposure the client sideworking exposure or learning matters alot so sometimes people stay in the samecompany for that as well so pleaseunderstand that each company eachaccount each project is unique eachperson's situation is unique I can'tguess how many other people are there inyour team who have the Visa already andyour manager might have made similarpromises to them so there may be a queueof people waiting to go inside you maybe at the fifth position I have no ideaor nobody over here has no idea of whatis your situation each person is in aunique situation so the decision has tobe made by that person knowing theecosystem in which that person isoperating all right I hope that makessense to you and I hope that helps youto make a logical decision if you feelthis information is helpful do share itwith others in your WhatsApp groups dotake care of yourself and I'll see you in another video very soon bye for now.
