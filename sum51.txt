My total work experience with Deloitte USAI is only of 6 months. I have done one busy season, one before busy season and one after busy season. I didn't have any background in auditing. That's why I was considered as a fresher chartered accountant. When you join Indian Big Four then the clients there are Indian companies. You go to the client place and audit and you stay on the front face. But when you join Global Big Force then there are no Indian companies and all the clients are outside India.
