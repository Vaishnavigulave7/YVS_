So I just received these all packages from Google and there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 packages. Except the iPhone, we'll talk about this later. Also, I will be adding the cost of everything that I have received here. And you can see it somewhere on the top. So, let's start with the most important package. Without which this video cannot be made. And I would need this. The Noogler hat. Let's just flip it. Ahhhhh. This is the Noogler hat. Let me just remove this. And I have this note here which says, congratulations and welcome. Cool. And coming to the cost of this thing, I don't think you can buy it online. Let's skip this. Next we have this box that I have already opened so I know what's inside it. This is the phone that Google gives you. Let me just... I have a corporate SIM from Airtel. And this is the phone here. And while this is getting set up, let me tell you that you can get an iPhone as well.  This one is my personal one. But for iPhone, you need a director level approval or you need a business use case.  And I didn't have any use case so I went with the Pixel 4a. Before that, what all do we get in the box? The image ejector tool. Let me set this up. Along with documentation. There's a power brick. There's a charging cable. USB-C to USB-C as expected. A USB-C to USB-A connector. They know that this belongs to an organization. Let's see. I'll set this up later. So the retail price for this phone is Rs.32,000. Okay, so this is the phone then. So next up I have the most obvious stuff. And this is the M1 Pro model of 2021. With 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. This is the laptop. Along with this, you get a charging cable. It has all the documents. Are there Apple stickers? These are all the documentations that you get. And lastly, you get this charger. I've already unboxed this because I've been working for around a month now. Stop unboxing YouTube videos. This is the laptop. I'm talking about the price. This costs Rs.2,40,000. Next, I have this Google branded box. Let's unbox this. This looks pretty nice. Okay. It has Google stickers. Two of them. A Noogler card. Welcome aboard. It's a pleasure to have you here.It is a pleasure to have you join us. Lots of good wishes on becoming a part of this unique, collaborative, dynamic and vibrant organization. Thank you. So this is Bangalore Pacific Swags. I can put my photo here. I have this Google Pen. And another pen, I think. Yep. A Google mug. Two Google Diaries. Google Pouch. And I think it'll last for a backpack. Yep. So this is the Google Bangalore Swag that everyone keeps referring to. Next is something big. We have this. I have got some stuff for onboarding from this. Like the swag and the laptop. I have ordered some stuff from Google's internal portal. So as an SDE, I can order some stuff. The monitor has been flagged. The power cord is done. I have a display cable. A USB-C to USB-C. An HDMI to HDMI. A CD, if you're still living in 2004. This seems like the power brick. The stand. We'll lock it in place. It's looking pretty big. Okay. This seems to be up. Okay. So this is an LG 27 inch IPS 4K monitor. And it's price is 51,000. On to the next one. So next up is. I think these are headphones. I think I know what these are. These are the headphones that Google gives. The packing is really, really nice. They look pretty good. Their look and feel is pretty premium. I'd say that their quality is okayish. Let me check the price. These are worth 17,000. I never give them for free. Next is this package. This one is going to be pretty easy. This is a pretty generic keyboard. And maybe a mouse, I guess. Yup. And adapters. Because I cannot use this on the MacBook. Okay, so this is supposed to be the last pack. Let me just open it. Okay. Let me show it to you. This is also provided by Google. This was also an option. This is a pretty easy one. This is a full HD Logitech webcam. This thing costs 14,000. It's price is around 15,000. And it's price is around 15,000. This thing costs 14,000. It's pretty high. Okay, lastly, a power brick. And this is an Elgato key light. So, let me just open this up. And this key light is worth 20,000. The manual. And this might be the stand. This is the light. I'm not going to set this up. This looks like a big task. This is it. This is all the stuff that I've got from Google. And its total will be written here. Which I think would be a lot.  And if you want to know how I went from almost no knowledge in coding to working at Google, then you should check this video out where I talk about three mistakes that I made that you don't have to make.
