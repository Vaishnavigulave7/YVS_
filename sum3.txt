I've reversed zero length list, inverted zero binary trees, and solved zero dynamic programming problema. But at least I get to eat free food every day. In terms of just friendliness, like people are very nice. It's definitely not a toxic place at all. I I probably work about 40 to 45 hours a week. I think that's probably about average in my team. I'm there's teams that work a lot less.
