.The first few months of the job are very good because you don't have so much workload and no big responsibility is put on you in the beginning. Then you have to own up things slowly and the more individually you do things without any support, the more you learn. I consider myself very lucky that I was deployed in the in-house development project of SCL. Here we get to learn a lot of technology and we implement these technologies in projects.
