I was working in TCS. I didn't like the work there. My bond was 50,000. So that would have broken. And I had to serve notice. So which company gives the money in a year. So I kept upskilling. And kept studying. And in July I got a job I resigned in July. The design is simple Just send a mail to HR or manager. And that's it.
