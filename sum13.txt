Corporate Kahani talks about the perks and benefits of joining TCS. TCS health insurance is very robust and helps employees a lot. The biggest benefit of TCS is that many projects in TCS you are released from one project, then it will not take much time to take another. If you are an employee of TCs and you have some dependents who are added in your insurance then they get 6000 rupees every year to claim their medicine expenses.
