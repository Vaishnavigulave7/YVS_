I've been working at Google as a software engineer since last year after I escaped unemployment. I've reversed zero length list, inverted zero binary trees, and solved zero dynamic programming problems. But at least I get to eat free food every day. In terms of the tech this is really the most interesting part for me and maybe for a lot of you especially the engineers who are watching this.
