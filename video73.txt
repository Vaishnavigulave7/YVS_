Hi guys welcome to my youtube channel as you might have seen from my thumbnail I quit my job from my company.  I was working in TCS. So why I had to resign.  It's been a year or two since I quit my job. So why I resigned, how I resigned. I resigned because last year on 12th August 2021 I joined the company. I had joined as a ninja profile I had upgraded after 3 months. I had given DC exam and my digital ninja was converted. So I was thinking why I resigned I am in TCS and everyone calls me a boss. And if you join TCS once, you can't join again. People are scared to quit. So I decided to work in TCS I didn't like the work there I got a support project I was a digital candidate And I got a support project. And there was no lending. There was no technology Simply sending mail and replying mails. Signing ticket to the Resolve team. Resolve team was not mine, I had an assigning team. And that was the work Just keep checking the dashboard and sign the ticket. That was the work. So I thought I had to change. This won't happen So I couldn't change My bond was 50,000. So that would have broken. And I had to serve notice. So which company gives the money in a year. And I didn't have any knowledge of the industry. So there was no te.chnology, no relevant experience. So I kept upskilling. And kept studying And when I came to TCS in May of 2022. I thought if I resign in May. And complete 3 months. Then by this August. I will complete 1 year. And if I resign in June. Then I will complete 1 year. And since then I was looking for a job. And in July I got a job I resigned in July. The design is simple Just send a mail to HR or manager. And that's it. And after that the notice period will start. So that was my 20 days notice period. I worked for 1 year and 2 months. And I will give my last working on 3rd October. And I will join the company on 10th October. So I will tell you which company I am in. Till then bye.
