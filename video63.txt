okaythere is no option for you to work fromthe accommodation definitely you need tovisit the Accenture office there youhave to sign into your laptop and attendthis meeting okay inside the new Joineruh

will be having in a fourthor fifth day the metowers uh experiencewill be there for you so it is quiteinteresting so in Virtual onboardingalso I have when I have onboarded theyhave used this my Towers onboarding souh the day will be very fun andinteractive and one of our subscribersalso told this and I would like to thankthe subscribers who have given me thisphysical onboarding infoso guys after these uh things okay likenew join your experience and met oursessions your trainings will be begin soin this trainings they will be brieflyexplaining you like uh about the ethicsand compliance and mandatory courseswhich you need to finish and about thealchem trainings and other learningmodules also will be there so this isnot sure like they will be uh assigningyour physical trainer in order toexplain you all these things it's notthat case so there may be the virtualcourses or modules which are assigned toyou in your system so you need to signin and finish those uh courses okay soall the trainings which are assigned toyou you need to finish them in thestipulated time guys so please focus onthem and try to wrap them as soon aspossible so if you finish these uhmandatory courses uh you will get sometime to prepare for the primerassessment which you need to providemandate really so this assessment istotally with the mcqs so please beprepared with your assessmentso before giving your actual primerassessment there will be a mock primerassessment guys so this is a mandatorymock that you're gonna give so beprepared for that and if you give a mockprimer assessment you will be getting aclear idea of what actual primerassessment questions will be like thepattern or types of questions they wereasking you will be have a clear idea soonce you clear this primer assessmentyou will be having a option like streampreference guys so there will be uh fouroptions or four to five options so thoseoptions are like Java stream or Oraclestream SQL stream AB AP stream sapstream so here you will be havingcertain options for you so you need tochoose one of those streams and on thatstream they will be providing you thetrainings suppose you have chosen Javaso they will be providing you trainingsupon Java if you have chosen Oracle thenthey will be providing Builder trainingson Oracle so these trainings will bearound two months guys so two months ofstream trainings will be happen to youso after this trainings also there willbe one assessment checking for yourtrainings so stream trainings so onceyou clear this assessment which are onthe stream then you are ready to beallocated to a project so guys uh onceyou clear this assessment only then youare eligible to be allocated to aproject so this is overall about thephysical onboarding guys from day one totill you get your project allocation sothe project allocation also depends uhlike they will be taking your interviewso for every project as far as I knowthere will be a client interview or elseproject manager interview will be thereso you need to clear that interview aswell so don't worry they will be askingyou the basic questions if you are afresher so now with this I think I havecovered more most of the topics so if Ihave missed in if in case like any Topicin your physical onboarding you canmention in the comment section so thatthe candidates can understand so afterthis there are certain FAQs are there soI would like to answer those FAQs inthis video so now let's move to the FAQsection guys so the first question hereiswill you receive salary during trainingsyes so the answer is definitely yes sofrom the day one in Accenture your timecounts okay every R is counted likeworking R is counted and this duringthis working hours like how many hoursyou worked so those all hours will becalculated and you will be getting yourfirst month's salary in your trainingperiod as well so from the day one youjoined Accenture you are billable okay Imean you are able to get your salary nowlet's move the second question like do Ineed to follow any dress code so this isthe second question uh like there isactually in Virtual onboarding like wedon't know any dress course andeverything like that but I come to knowthat in physical onboarding they dofollow the dress codes so on yourorientation day please try to wear theformal dresses guys so like if formaldress means like with Blazer and withoutBlazer like two types we are havingright if you have a Blazer and if youare feeling comfortable with blazer youcan wear the Blazer like both the womenand men employees you can wear theBlazer so here I have shown you thesample uh picks upon using Blazer so ifyou don't want to wear any Blazer andyou don't need any Blazer like you don'thave any Blazer then you can wear theformal types so girls you can uh I meanwomen employees can wear the churidarsor whatever like the it should be likeformal looking okay so I have shown youthe sample uh form here okay this typeyou can wear and visit your office onyour day one so please try to followthis dress codes I think they will bealso mentioning you these details inyour orientation day for uh like foryour working days in Accenture as wellso okay guys now let's move to the thirdquestionso the third question is after trainingscan I relocateso this question might be a reframed aswell like after trainings or onboardingscan I relocate so the answer is simpleguys yes you can relocate so the reasonis here uh at a time bulk of candidatesare uh you know recruited and onboardedright so if everyone is requesting forthe location change it will be a problemto them as well to relocate soeven like most of the candidates beforeonboarding itself they are requestingthe HR Maps or Talent resources likeplease relocate from one location to theanother location I know like mostly 90percent of the candidates have receivedthe rejection mails and some of thecandidates haven't received evenresponse back from them so this is uhbecause like as I have already mentionedyou because of bulk recruitment at atime and this is not like work fromOffice like this is not virtual rightnow it is like everything is from workfrom office and you are having physicalonboardings they are sending you therejection mails so previously it was notthe case like they used to relocate veryeasily but now it is very very tough foryou to get your like preferred locationso for this okay if you are asking meokay if you're asking me afteronboarding okay after my trainings gotcompleted can I relocate so the answeris really s guys so why I am discussingthis is most of the subscribers okayso if you can see here like they wereasking me for the relocation so most ofthe guys are messaging me from onelocation to another location how torelocate and is it possible afteronboarding can I relocate like that so Iwould like to answer all you guys likewhoever all like uh they wanted torelocate there is one option likeemployee initiate transfer okay so EITis nothing but uh you yourself areinitiating a transfer request so this isonly uh you know this can be only donethrough the Accenture mail ID so as soonas you get your Enterprise mail ID thenuh there will be one portal okayAccenture Service Tool in that you canraise your transfer request and this isalso uh based on the approval okay ifyour HR or project manager approves thisthen you can relocate okayso guys please don't get disappointedbecause you are having an option evenafter onboarding so before onboardingeven if they reject uh so please bearfor few more days so after youronboarding still they are not relocatingplease speak up with your projectmanager if possible or any HR so if theyare not approving it any course you canraise the transfer request so that uhthey will think about this and if anypossibilities are they definitelyrelocate you to your preferred locationnow let's move to the another FAQ whichis last oneso the fourth question uh which isnothing but like will travel elements beprovided okay so in order to move fromyour location okay from your uh a nativelocation to the work location the travelexpenses will happen right so thequestion is like will that travel exexpenses can be claimed or not so guysyou can claim that travel allowance uhso in order to claim there are certainsteps which you need to be followed sothere is a bot okay chat bot uh inAccenture which is nothing but Deepa soin Deepa you can ask your questions sothat Deepa will answer you uh like whatare the steps you require in order toraise uh or request for your travelelements so using those tips if youfollow that then you can claim yourtravel allowances so that's it guysthat's it uh overall about the physicalonboarding which I want to uh convey youand the most requested video so most ofthe guys are getting onboarded
