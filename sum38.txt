Google was celebrating one Heather by the Unite event because of which we could do so many activities. So we went to the gym, the pantry, the canteen, the gym and the micro kitchen. After the lunch, I attended some meetings and completed my work at Google's office. So you need to watch this video till the end so that you don't miss anything.
