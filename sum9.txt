I joined IBM around 4 and a half years ago. I would say it's a very good company. IBM's first benefit is its work culture. Second thing is work life balance. Third is your skill. According to skill. That have to maintain 40 hours. You have to complete 40 hours every year. Other than some mandatory training, you have to upgrade your skills for 40. hours.
