It's been a year since I started my first job in Accenture. I was a college student. So things were very new for me. I didn't even know how corporate works. In the beginning, I forgot to check my email. I used to miss meetings.Sometimes I got very late in meetings. And I had a lot of problems. I honestly admit that I took a year to adjust.
