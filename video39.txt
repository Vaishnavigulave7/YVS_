Hello everyone, I hope you all are doing well. My name is Aarti and welcome back to my YouTube channel. You might have heard a lot about Google Office infrastructure, their amenities and of course food facilities. So I am really excited to share that with you. I hope you really enjoy this video and here you go. Other than the big cafes, the whole of Google campus is full of microkitchens. The idea is that employees should have never been more than 12 feet away from a kitchen. Or in other words, not an office, it's your home. Microkitchens have fruits, snacks and other healthy drink options which you can never get bored of. Google make use of its office space to create the happiest, most productive workplace in the world. Each workspace is designed to stimulate creativity and ultimately encourage social interaction with members from structurally separate teams. Four things that make Google's office so Googley is color, color, color and color. Google office is a design that encourages everybody here to work. Somebody just featured in the video. So let me introduce you to my fellow Googler and Noogler meet Saransh, Sandeep and Anand. Google offices has tons of physical activities that are available to Googlers including snooker, foosball, table tennis, video game, etc. Hey, Manj. So you're taking massage. How's it? Yeah, it's good. Try it. Okay, cool. Google's legendary free lunch at its various offices worldwide ranges from government lunch to delicious desserts. It's too easy to see the free food as a means to fuel workers.  But at Google, free food is fuel for innovation. There's a lot of food and it is delicious.
