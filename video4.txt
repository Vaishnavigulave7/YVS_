So, next HSPP It

means Employer Stock Purchase Plan

It means that the employees are getting their company's stocks and shares at a discounted price Now, this is a very nice thing

According to me Because you get your company's shares at a very discounted price

Not very much But yes, you get it at a very good discounted price

50. you directly get that much profit Now, for example, if you have a 100 rupees stock

You get 15 or 20 rupees discount on it 50, you directly get a profit of 15-20

And a lot of companies like Salesforce, Adobe, Microsoft

They all do ESPP

Now, everyone has

Some 10

Some have 159

different ones

Some have some other norms Okay?

So, it depends on the company But a lot of other companies like Google Don't give ESFP

Okay?

There are a lot of other companies that don't

So, it's a very nice thing

really like this

330, you can put an X amount of your salary I have put that maximum X amount

Bo, nice This enhanced salary is also a little less

ESPP.
