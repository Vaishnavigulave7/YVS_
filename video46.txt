Hello guys, welcome back again to my YouTube channel, The Lady Saga.If you guys don't know me, I am Megha and I hope you all are doing lovely.So guys, in today's video, we are going to review IBM.So we will be covering few things about IBM.So first of all, we are going to discuss about the cons and pros of working in IBM.If you work in IBM, then what projects you will be working on,we will be discussing about the work-life balance also and what are the employee benefits you will get.So all these are the topics that we will be covering in today's video.But before we start today's video, I request you all to please subscribe my channel if you haven't subscribed it yet.And do press the bell button so that you can keep getting the notifications whenever I post a new video for you.So let us discuss all these points one by one.So whenever you join IBM, initially as a fresher, you will be joining IBM either as a software engineer or as an associate software engineer.So the entry level position in IBM, that is either of a software engineer or an associate software engineer.So firstly, let me describe you about the training that IBM gives to its employees.IBM training gives to its employees, it is more likely other service based companies.In fact, you will be surprised to know that the IBM training that IBM gives to its employees is much better as compared to the other companies.
For example, you have joined IBM as a full stack developer.So it might be the possibility that your training might get extended to 3-4 months depending upon the profile that you have joined.On the other hand, if you have joined IBM as a front end developer, then your training can be around 1 month.So it completely depends upon the profile that you join IBM.So let me tell you what kind of training is given to you in IBM.So whenever your training starts in IBM, you are given theoretical training first.Then you are given practical classroom based training in which you are given assignments, lab tests, etc.Now as you are done with training, you are assigned projects.The projects that are assigned to you completely depend upon the profile in which you are appointed in IBM.You will be surprised to know that IBM works on a lot of new technologies.Now it completely depends upon your skill and your rep in the company that which project is assigned to you.Now let me tell you an interesting thing about IBM. IBM works on a lot of support projects.So it might be the possibility that initially as a fresher you are assigned a support project.
But make sure that you don't think that you haven't got a coding based project at that time.Because as a fresher you will get to learn a lot in support projects.Also, one thing I want to highlight about IBM is that IBM is a very professional company.
Where you not only get things to learn on the professional front, but you also get many other things to learn.Like you get a chance to upgrade your communication skills.People in IBM are very helpful, they are very supportive. You will get many many things to learn from your seniors.Let me tell you one more thing about IBM. IBM employs one of the best talent in India.Like the creamy layer. So definitely you will get to learn a lot if you join IBM.Now let us discuss about the salaries, hikes and appraisals in IBM.There is only one drawback of working in IBM.The promotions and hikes that you get are not in accordance with the market standards.The possible reason might be that IBM hires a lot of people.Because of which the promotions and hikes can't give according to the market standards.Maximum hike which you can expect after working for a year in IBM is approximately 5% to 8%.Now the promotions in IBM are very slow. To get promotions in IBM, you have to work very hard.So I would say that if you join IBM as a fresher, initially it is a very good company to kick start your career.But in the long run, you will not get satisfaction due to the indecent hikes and appraisals which IBM gives to its employees.Now let me discuss about the work-life balance in IBM.The work-life balance in IBM is very good as compared to the other IT service based companies.Here the workload you get as compared to the other IT companies is very nominal.Other policies are employee friendly. You can easily get the leaves whenever you want.If I talk about the employee benefits, you get medical insurance, you easily get the reimbursement and you get a lot of food coupons.Now let us discuss the overall review of IBM.So if I talk about the overall review, IBM is a very good company to start your career as a fresher. You will get to learn a lot on the learning front.But in the long term, I would suggest, that's my personal suggestion to you, that you should set your standards high.Initially as a fresher, you can take a few years to learn some things on the professional front to upgrade your skills.But in the long term, you will not get the satisfaction in terms of money and in terms of career growth.So after working for around 2-3 years, I suggest that you should make a switch after working in IBM because your salary will be less according to the market.So that's all about IBM and I hope you liked my video.
